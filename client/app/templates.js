For example staying on campus will usually cost you more than staying off campus. Undergraduate freshman students in some universities may be required to stay on campus for the first year which may considerably increase the cost of living. Also whether you decide to stay alone or live with mates will impact your cost.<br><br> Accommodation cost will typically range from $3,000 and $8,000 per year. If you decide to hire an apartment, remember than the ancillary costs such as electricity, phone line, furniture and travel costs to and from the university are your responsibility.<br><br> Some of the other costs which you may budget for could be fees for student activities which amount to a few hundred dollars per year. Most students have to buy some reference books through the year which can cost between $500 and $1,500 per year.
