Those who have graduated from junior colleges may enroll in universities, industrial universities or open universities.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>3. Graduate Schools</h4>\r\n				<p>Graduate schools are designed to pursue the objectives of higher education more profoundly, while cultivating both the ability to guide academic research and creative talent. These are divided into generalist graduate schools centered on academic research and specialist graduate schools which are practice-orientated.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>4. Master’s Course</h4>\r\n				<p>The required course of study for a Master is two years or more. Usually, students are required to obtain 24 credits. After gaining the prescribed credits and passing the set examination, candidates for a Master degree submit a Master thesis which must pass the examination of at least three examiners.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>5. D Course</h4>\r\n				<p>The required course of study for a Ph. D is three years or more. Usually, students are required to obtain 36 credits. After gaining the prescribed credits and passing the comprehensive examination, candidates for a Ph. D submit a Ph. D thesis which must pass the examination of at least five examiners.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>6. Post-Doc Course</h4>\r\n				<p>These courses are for continuing research after completion of a Ph. D course. Presently, many Korean universities are inviting post-doc researchers to work on research projects for the BK21 program.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h3> Why in South Korea?</h3>\r\n				<p>South Korea has many unique advantages as a study abroad destination. Here are ten reasons why you should consider studying abroad in South Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>1. Korean Language.</h4>\r\n\r\n				<h4>2. Strong Academic Atmosphere</h4>\r\n				<p>South Koreans take education very seriously, particularly higher education. Academics can be competitive, but students treat teachers with respect and are very serious about their education.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>3. Tae Kwan Do</h4>\r\n				<p>This particular variety of martial arts originated in South Korea and is the country’s national sport today.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>4. Korean Food</h4>\r\n				<p>Though Korean food has some elements in common with other Asian cuisine, the combinations, ingredients, and unique flavors produce entirely new dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>5. Friendly People</h4>\r\n				<p>Korean people are friendly and helpful. Though there are cultural differences when it comes to etiquette and interpersonal relationships, this should not be a challenge to students in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>6. Korean Amusement Parks</h4>\r\n				<p>Amusement parks are fun points of interest for travelers of all ages, but they are especially popular with high school and college-aged travelers.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>7. Norebang</h4>\r\n				<p>Karaoke isn’t for anyone, but the unique Korean version of karaoke known as norebang may appeal to more shy participants. Norebang occurs in small private rooms with a group of friends, so you won’t be embarrassed in front of strangers. Norebang is very popular in South Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>8. Shopping</h4>\r\n				<p>Shopping is a 24/7 activity in South Korea, with shops open day and night. There are shopping centers everywhere, and the goods available span every need, desire, and budget possible.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h4>9. Access to Asia</h4>\r\n				<p>While you are in South Korea, take advantage of its proximity to other popular Asian destinations. Many South Korea study abroad partcipants like to travel to China, Japan, and elsewhere before returning home.</p>\r\n\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"container-fluid main-second-div\">\r\n		<div class=\"container\">\r\n			<div class=\"row text-center\">\r\n				<!--<h2>Public Higher Educational Institutions</h2>-->\r\n				<p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Edu-Action will help students to receive valuable information about living in Korea, life as a student at your institution, tips on adapting to the culture, and dealing with homesickness.

The local universities are getting better</h3>\r\n				<p>\r\n					While not yet a rival to Singapore, Hong Kong, China or Singapore, Malaysia’s domestic universities are fast improving. <br> Universiti Malaya in the capital Kuala Lumpur is ranked 167th in the 2013/14 QS World University Ratings and its computer science, education and engineering programmes preside in the world’s top 100. Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi, Selangor, close to Kuala Lumpur, is well renowned in the education, politics, engineering, law and mathematics fields. And Universiti Sains Malaysia is the only institution in Malaysia to boast a subject in the top 50 – its environmental studies programme is ranked joint 28th.\r\n				</p>\r\n				\r\n				<h3>2. You can get a US, UK and Australian degree there...</h3>\r\n				<p>A major part of Malaysia’s state investment in higher education is its growing partnerships with universities in other countries. Many foreign universities, especially Australian and British, have branch campuses in Malaysia.\r\nFor example, Monash University (Australia) and the University of Nottingham (UK), both of which are in the top 100 universities in the world, have branch campuses in Malaysia. <br>\r\nKBU International College is partnered with Anglia Ruskin, Nottingham Trent and Sheffield Hallam universities in the UK.\r\nIn the southern Malaysia city of Johor, developers are building EduCity Iskandar, a giant international student village and campus shared by eight leading universities. Four are operational and the others will be completed by the year 2018. They will include the universities of Reading, Southampton and Newcastle (medicine) in the UK, the Netherlands’ Maritime Institute of Technology, Singapore’s private Raffles University and the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts from the US. An Olympic-sized swimming pool and14,000-seat sports stadium are among the impressive facilities the campus will boast when it is completed in 2018.</p>\r\n				\r\n				<h3>3. …at a lower cost</h3>\r\n				<p>While an undergraduate course at the UK Campus of the University of Nottingham would cost £13,470, the same course at the Malaysia campus would cost just under half as much (39,990MYR/ approximately £7,000). The course is the same module content, has the same evaluation criteria and the same marking scheme which results in receiving the same degree with the same status, but at a significantly lower cost. Also take into consideration that the cost of living in Malysia in comparision to that of the UK is considerably lower too which means your maintenance costs are less of a financial burden too. It’s a win-win situation.</p>\r\n				\r\n				<h3>4. It’s majorly multicultural </h3>\r\n				<p>Malaysia is amulti-ethnic melting pot. Just half the population is Malay while almost a quarter is Chinese and over seven per cent is Indian. Whilst Malay is the official language of Malaysia, English is a recognised language and widely spoken. Such a setting is a great foundation for international students to make them feel at home in addition to having a sense of belonging. The global community allows for religious, cultural and social acceptance and is testimony to the fact that Malaysia is home to just under 100,000 international students. Studying at university is not solely an academic experience and having the opportunity to appreciate the different facets, cultures and religions that make up the Malaysian identity is a learning curve in its own right.</p>\r\n				\r\n				<h3>5. It needs skilled graduates. </h3>\r\n				<p>With certain industries on the rise and a growing economy, Malaysia is in need of skilled workers. Industry makes up a significant part of the country’s GDP with oil, gas and palm oil making leaps and bounds in the export markets. In addition, there is a particular demand for graduates in accounting, biotechnology and computer science sectors. Being able to witness the development of these industries will keep you ahead of the game as well as to having the opportunity to network to make the all-important contacts to get your first step on the career ladder.</p>\r\n				\r\n				<h3>It’s simply beautiful</h3>\r\n				<p>Being a student may well be a full time occupation but a break every now and then is surely well deserved! Why not set off and explore the beautiful and diverse landscape Malaysia has to offer? You can wade through the jungle in Taman Negara National Park or head to the rainforest in Malaysian Borneo. Find a reprieve from the humid heat in addition to getting peace and quiet by heading up to the Cameron Highlands. Or walk through a UNESCO Heritage site in the form of the colonial streets of George Town in Penang before savouring the culinary delights there. But if you wish to escape it all, paradise is found in the form of the Perhentian Islands.

Accommodation costs will vary depending on where you stay (on or off campus) and the type of accommodation you choose (full board or self-catering). If you choose not to live in university accommodation then you will have to pay Council Tax which is a charge for local community services such as the police, fire brigade, rubbish collection and leisure services. <br><br> Students on full-time courses lasting 6 months or more are eligible for treatment from the National Health Service (NHS). This includes free doctor’s examinations and hospital treatment from the start of your course. Your spouse and children under 16 (or under 19 if still in school) will also be entitled to this benefit. <br><br>Other costs to be included when planning your budget are local travel, telephone, entertainment, clothing, groceries and incidentals. It is also prudent to include international travel costs if you decide to go back home during the semester breaks.\r\n\r\n				</p>\r\n\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div uib-accordion-group class=\"panel-default\" heading=\"Living in Malaysia\">\r\n\r\n\r\n				<p>Accommodation, either on-campus or off-campus, is reasonable and within the students’ budget. The cost of living while you are studying in Malaysia will depend on the location and lifestyle you keep up with.</p><br>\r\n\r\n				<p>The average monthly rental for a single room (twin-sharing) per student is between RM250 and RM450 (USD68 to USD122). Other expenses such as food, transportation, laundry and other essentials, based on an ordinary lifestyle, are estimated to be between RM600 and RM700 (USD162 to USD189 per month).</p><br>\r\n\r\n				<p>Therefore, the total cost of living will average to approximately between RM900 and RM1,200 (USD243 to USD324) per month or about RM11,000 to RM14,000 (USD 2,973 to USD3,784) per year (12 months) for one student. Again, this is dependent on the student’s style of living, as well as the cost of living that varies from one location to another.</p><br>\r\n\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			<div uib-accordion-group class=\"panel-default\" heading=\"Counselling\">\r\n				<p>Edu-Action counsellors are the market leading international education counsellors who offer you impartial and professional advice on international higher education institution and course options based on your academic qualifications and work experience, keeping in mind your budget, city and other preferences.</p><br>\r\n\r\n				<h3>Institutions Application Processing</h3>\r\n				<p>Edu-Action offices have all the relevant institution application forms, brochures and handbooks.

The institution will then help YOU apply for a student pass at the Malaysian Immigration Department in Malaysia prior to YOUR arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h3>Step 3</h3>\r\n				<p>A letter of approval for a student pass will then be released by the Malaysian Immigration Department to the educational institution which has offered YOU a place to study. The educational institution will send the approval letter to YOU while YOU are still in YOUR own country.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h3>Step 4</h3>\r\n				<p>Before leaving YOUR country for Malaysia, YOU must inform the educational institution of YOUR port of entry (airport), flight number, arrival date and time.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h3>Step 5</h3>\r\n				<p>Upon YOUR arrival at the airport in Malaysia, the educational institution’s representative will receive YOU at the immigration check-point at the Malaysian airport. A visa will be issued to YOU at the entry point in the form of an endorsement on YOUR valid national passport. A Special Pass will be issued at the entry point to refer you to the nearest State Immigration Department for issuance of a Student Pass.

While the entire continent of Asia is heralded as a rising star in the world of international higher education, Singapore is outpacing the rest in establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with thanks to dogged government initiatives focused on the importance of educational innovation — not only in terms of acquiring superpower status, but also specifically –and uniquely — as it pertains to the country’s own economy. </p><br>\r\n\r\n				<p><strong>2) You will assure yourself a degree highly renowned by employers.</strong></p>\r\n				<p>Singapore was ranked as one of QS’s top three “Best Student Cities” in 2013 for a multitude of reasons. Of course, there’s its extraordinary reputation as an epicenter for higher education, research and innovation thanks to a combination of government imperatives, top-ranked universities, a collaborative spirit and a magnificent quality of life. <br> Because of Singapore’s renown superiority in the field of education, employers increasingly seek out its grads — both in Asia and across the globe. Both NUS and Nanyang Technological University score higher in the QS World University rankings, due in no small part to their ability to attract top students and faculty from all over the world. The city’s commitment to educational imperatives makes it one of the world’s most desirable spots for students — not only because of the education they receive while there, but also because of the many doors opened by a Singaporean degree.</p><br>\r\n\r\n				<p><strong>3) You will experience a student life like no other.</strong></p>\r\n				<p>\r\n					&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1 .Safety Matters</strong> <br><br> Aside from the fact that Singapore is a diverse, beautiful and vibrant place to live, it also excels in terms of safety. Strict laws and correspondingly low crime rates mean that city streets and public transportation methods are exceptionally secure for wanderers. In fact, TripAdvisor recently awarded Singapore the #2 spot on its list of the World’s Safest Cities, behind only Tokyo. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Diversity Abounds</strong> <br><br> Diversity isn’t just accepted in Singapore, it is abundantly welcomed. A large percentage of expats offer a comfortable environment for newcomers and the town — and even the taxi drivers — is celebrated for its friendliness to strangers. The melding of so many unique cultures offers a unique worldview for residents and visiting scholars alike. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Anytime, Anywhere</strong> <br><br> If action is your endgame, then there’s no place quite like Singapore. The city is alive with people and activities throughout the day and well into evening. Night owls in particular will love life here, where shops, restaurants and other attractions remain open way into the wee hours. An extraordinary breadth and depth of local cuisine, unparalleled shopping and even a world-celebrated zoo, mean that no one is ever bored in Singapore. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><br><br>4. You Pay for What You Get</strong> <br><br> Yes, Singapore is expensive. However, people who live here enjoy access to terrific amenities that just make life better. From efficient services to cheap public transportation to the sublime Changi Airport, Singaporeans enjoy an extremely high quality of life considered by many to be well worth the expense. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> <br> <br>5. English Abounds</strong> <br><br> While Singapore may seem like a far-off destination, international students quickly acclimate to life here thanks to its four official languages, and the remarkable prevalence of English — spoken by a full 75 percent of its population. In fact, English is Singapore’s official educational language.\r\n\r\n				</p>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class=\"container-fluid main-second-div\">\r\n		<div class=\"container\">\r\n			<div class=\"row text-center\">\r\n				<!--<h2>Public Higher Educational Institutions</h2>-->\r\n				<p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Grads of Singaporean higher educational institutions are primed and ready to conquer the ever-evolving global economy as well as their own local one thanks to a shared vision, explicitly defined outcomes as well as strategies toward their achievement.</p>\r\n				<button class=\"btn btn-primary\"  ng-click=\"go_apply_college()\" class=\"clickable\">APPLY NOW</button>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n\r\n	<!--	<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n		<div class=\"row\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000;\">\r\n			<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\r\n				<h3>Intensive shorter tertiary education</h3>\r\n				<p>The distinct advantage that the UK education system has is the fact that the duration of most of the undergraduate honours degrees is 3 years and the taught Masters courses is 1 year.

What’s more, immigration requirements to study in Singapore are remarkably straightforward, even if you do need a visa to enter the country. Our breakdown of the visa application process will help you get your head around what needs to be done. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTo study in Singapore you will need something that is called a Student’s Pass. Some students will need a visa to enter the country as well as a Student’s Pass.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe application process for a Student’s Pass is the same for students who require and visa and those who don’t: the only difference is that if you need a visa, you’ll have to complete your Student’s Pass application from your home country. Students who do not require a visa to enter Singapore may apply for a Student’s Pass once already in the country.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStudents from some nationalities will need a visa to enter Singapore. These students may apply for a visa using the Student’s Pass Online Application & Registration (SOLAR+) online system after their host institution has registered them with it. If your visa application is successful, you will be issued a new SOLAR+ application number that you can use to apply for a Student Pass from your home country. You’ll also need to pay an additional visa fee when you collect your Student’s Pass from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Singapore.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCheck if you need a visa to enter Singapore</p>\r\n			\r\n				<h3>Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning</h3>\r\n				<p>All foreign students accepted into a full-time study programme in a Singapore Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) must apply for a Student Pass online through the SOLAR+ system. Once you complete the forms in the online application system, your host institution will lodge your application to the ICA for you. If your application is successful, you’ll need to complete the formality of going to an ICA office and collecting your Student Pass yourself. <br><br>\r\n\r\nInstitutions not included on this list will provide you with specific information about your immigration requirements when you are accepted into one of their study programmes.</p>\r\n			\r\n			<h3>Online Application SOLAR+</h3>\r\n			<p>Applications for a Student’s Pass done via SOLAR+ need to be submitted at least one month, but not more than two months before the commencement of your study programme. Before you can submit your application with SOLAR+, your IHL will register you with the system using your personal details as they appear in your passport, course details (including dates of commencement and finish), and your SOLAR+ application reference number. Your host will notify you once this is done, and you must then log onto SOLAR+ to complete the eForm 16.</p>\r\n			<strong>eForm 16</strong>\r\n				\r\n				<p> Before you log onto SOLAR+ to complete the eForm 16, you will need to have the following documents and information handy:\r\n				</p>\r\n				<ul>\r\n					<li> A registration acknowledgement notice from your host, acknowledging and confirming that they have successfully registered you with the SOLAR+ system</li>\r\n					<li> Passport details: passport number, nationality, date of expiry</li>\r\n					<li> NRIC/ FIN of parents if your parents are either Singaporean or are living or working in Singapore</li>\r\n					<li>Your address in Singapore if applicable. If you haven’t sorted out accommodation yet then you can put your university’s registered address</li>\r\n					<li>Your e-mail address</li>\r\n					<li>One recent passport-sized colour photograph that has been taken within the last 3 months. This will be pasted on the top-right hand corner of the form once it has been printed out.</li>\r\n				</ul>\r\n				<br>\r\n				<p>Once you have completed the form online through SOLAR+, you need to print a copy of it that you will need to submit in person to the Student’s Pass Unit (ICA) when you go to pick up your pass. You’ll also need to paste a passport-sized photo of yourself onto the top right-hand corner of the form before you do so. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe visa application processing time for students that do NOT require a visa to enter Singapore is five days. For students that do require a visa, the processing time is ten days.</p>\r\n		\r\n		<h3>IPA and Additional Requirements</h3>\r\n		<p>If your application is successful, you will be issued an In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter by your host institution. If you require a visa to enter Singapore, it will be attached to this letter. Your IPA letter will act as a provisional Student’s Pass until you go to collect it from an ICA office, and if applicable you can use it to enter the country.</p>\r\n		\r\n		<h3>Collecting your Student’s Pass</h3>\r\n		<p>In some cases, your host university may be authorised by the ICA to issue your Student’s Pass on campus.

Our aim is for you—our users—to always feel  informed and empowered with respect to your privacy on Edu-Action.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n	    <p>Edu-Action\' mission is to empower students to find and choose  the very best college. Our registered users share their information  with colleges, engage with colleges they\'re interested in, and post and view  content related to their college-search process. Content on some of our  services is also visible to unregistered viewers. We believe that our services  allow our users to efficiently select the best based on their search criteria.</p>\r\n	    <p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to  the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>\r\n	    <p>We protect your personal information and will only provide  it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry  out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our  features and functionality to you; (4) when we reasonably believe it is  required by law, subpoena or other legal process; or (5) as necessary to  enforce our User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service or protect the rights, property, or safety of  Edu-Action, its users and visitors, and the public.</p>\r\n	    <p>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed  to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</p>\r\n	    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Edu-Action.com and other Edu-Action  websites, apps, developer platforms and other products and services(collectively, the “ Services ”). We may  modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes  to it, we will provide notice through our website or by other means so that you  may review the changes before you continue to use Edu-Action. If you object to any  changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use  Edu-Action after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this  Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>\r\n	    <ul>\r\n	      <li><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>What  Information We Collect</strong><br><br></li>\r\n	      <ul>\r\n	        <li><strong>1.1&nbsp; </strong><strong>Data Controllers<br>\r\n	          </strong>The personal information provided to or gathered is controlled by Edu-Action,  231 Market Place #241, San ramon, CA 94583. If you have any concern about  providing information to us or having such information displayed on Edu-Action  services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you  should not become a user of Edu-Action, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use  our Services. If you have already registered, you can close your account.

You can choose to provide further  information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your mobile number, your  gender and/or your high school). We use this information to provide you with more  customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content,  and this information may also appear on your profile viewable by colleges. You acknowledge  that, by creating an account, Edu-Action and colleges will be able to identify you  by your profile, and you allow Edu-Action to use this information in accordance  with this Privacy Policy.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n	          <strong></strong></li>\r\n	        <li><strong>1.3&nbsp; </strong><strong>Profile Information<br>\r\n	          </strong>After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional  information on your Edu-Action profile, such as test scores, certifications,  career goals, and personal interests. With your approval, colleges may choose  to communicate with you based on the information you have provided. Providing  additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Edu-Action. Helping you provide a more complete profile allows prospective colleges to get to know you better. It also enables us to provide you with other relevant content such as scholarship information on and off our site.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li><strong>1.4   </strong><strong>Other Services That Sync With Edu-Action</strong><br>\r\n            Edu-Action makes other tools available to sync information with Edu-Action, and may also develop additional features that allow users to use their Edu-Action account in conjunction with other third-party services. Any information that you upload or sync with Edu-Action is covered by the User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.

For example, we collect  information when you import your transcript, participate in polls, install a  Edu-Action mobile application, and share articles on Edu-Action. If you are logged in  on Edu-Action or another Service and a Edu-Action cookie on your device identifies  you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.9 of this  policy(e.g., your IP address) will be associated with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP addresses.</li><br>\r\n	        <li><strong>1.7&nbsp;  </strong><strong>Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</strong><br>\r\n	          We receive information when you use your Edu-Action account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds Edu-Action plugins, we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a user when you visit sites with Edu-Action plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. Edu-Action will use this information to personalize the Edu-Action-provided functionality on third-party sites. Edu-Action may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting Edu-Action plugins and similar technologies to help them measure Edu-Action-generated traffic to their websites.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n	        <li><strong>1.8  </strong><strong>Cookies</strong><br>\r\n	         We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, improve your Edu-Action experience, increase security, measure use and assess effectiveness of our Services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools.

We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of  your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer  operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device  (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device  operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Edu-Action  using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may  also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or  GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information  on our mobile applications. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time  location data being sent to Edu-Action, and of course Edu-Action will honor your  settings.<br>\r\n        </p>\r\n	    <ul>\r\n	      <ul>\r\n	        <li><strong>1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Other</strong><br>\r\n	          Edu-Action is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer our users.

Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ul>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <ul>\r\n	      <li><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>How we use your personal information</strong><br><br></li>\r\n	      <ul>\r\n	        <li><strong>2.1&nbsp; </strong><strong>Consent to Edu-Action Processing Information About You</strong><br>\r\n	          The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to  identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile  (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing  personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile,  you are freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal  information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying to us any  information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your  part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to Edu-Action\'  collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in  accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, by changing your account  settings or your profile on Edu-Action, or by closing your respective account  here.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n	        <li><strong>2.2&nbsp; </strong><strong>Edu-Action Communications</strong><br>\r\n	         We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Edu-Action websites or apps, text messages, messages to your Edu-Action inbox, and other means available through the Services, including mobile text messages and push notifications.

Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to Edu-Action. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. <br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n	        <li><strong>2.8&nbsp; </strong><strong>Polls and Surveys</strong><br>\r\n	          Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Edu-Action, users, or third parties.

These services allow colleges to export limited information from users\' public profiles, in order to effectively recruit prospective students. A college may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a college application, in connection with Edu-Action’ platform. Any personal information obtained independently of Edu-Action services will not be added by Edu-Action to your profile and is not under Edu-Action’ control but is subject to the policies of Edu-Action.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n	        <li><strong>2.13&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Pages for Colleges</strong><br>\r\n	          Edu-Action allows colleges to create pages and news articles dedicated to their brand and mission.

We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not commit to challenge every demand.<br>\r\n	          <br>\r\n            </li>\r\n	        <li><strong>2.15&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Disclosures to Others as the Result  of a Change in Control or Sale of Edu-Action, Inc.</strong><br>\r\n	          We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Edu-Action, Inc., a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events.
