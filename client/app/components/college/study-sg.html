				<h3>Why Singapore?</h3>
				<p><strong>1) You will study in one of the best education systems in the world.</strong></p>
				<p>Your future is already bright, but a Singaporean education offers even greater gleam. While the entire continent of Asia is heralded as a rising star in the world of international higher education, Singapore is outpacing the rest in establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with thanks to dogged government initiatives focused on the importance of educational innovation — not only in terms of acquiring superpower status, but also specifically –and uniquely — as it pertains to the country’s own economy. </p><br>

				<p><strong>2) You will assure yourself a degree highly renowned by employers.</strong></p>
				<p>Singapore was ranked as one of QS’s top three “Best Student Cities” in 2013 for a multitude of reasons. Of course, there’s its extraordinary reputation as an epicenter for higher education, research and innovation thanks to a combination of government imperatives, top-ranked universities, a collaborative spirit and a magnificent quality of life. <br> Because of Singapore’s renown superiority in the field of education, employers increasingly seek out its grads — both in Asia and across the globe. Both NUS and Nanyang Technological University score higher in the QS World University rankings, due in no small part to their ability to attract top students and faculty from all over the world. The city’s commitment to educational imperatives makes it one of the world’s most desirable spots for students — not only because of the education they receive while there, but also because of the many doors opened by a Singaporean degree.</p><br>

				<p><strong>3) You will experience a student life like no other.</strong></p>
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1 .Safety Matters</strong> <br><br> Aside from the fact that Singapore is a diverse, beautiful and vibrant place to live, it also excels in terms of safety. Strict laws and correspondingly low crime rates mean that city streets and public transportation methods are exceptionally secure for wanderers. In fact, TripAdvisor recently awarded Singapore the #2 spot on its list of the World’s Safest Cities, behind only Tokyo. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Diversity Abounds</strong> <br><br> Diversity isn’t just accepted in Singapore, it is abundantly welcomed. A large percentage of expats offer a comfortable environment for newcomers and the town — and even the taxi drivers — is celebrated for its friendliness to strangers. The melding of so many unique cultures offers a unique worldview for residents and visiting scholars alike. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Anytime, Anywhere</strong> <br><br> If action is your endgame, then there’s no place quite like Singapore. The city is alive with people and activities throughout the day and well into evening. Night owls in particular will love life here, where shops, restaurants and other attractions remain open way into the wee hours. An extraordinary breadth and depth of local cuisine, unparalleled shopping and even a world-celebrated zoo, mean that no one is ever bored in Singapore. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><br><br>4. You Pay for What You Get</strong> <br><br> Yes, Singapore is expensive. However, people who live here enjoy access to terrific amenities that just make life better. From efficient services to cheap public transportation to the sublime Changi Airport, Singaporeans enjoy an extremely high quality of life considered by many to be well worth the expense. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. English Abounds</strong> <br><br> While Singapore may seem like a far-off destination, international students quickly acclimate to life here thanks to its four official languages, and the remarkable prevalence of English — spoken by a full 75 percent of its population. In fact, English is Singapore’s official educational language.

				<h3>Intensive shorter tertiary education</h3>
				<p>The distinct advantage that the UK education system has is the fact that the duration of most of the undergraduate honours degrees is 3 years and the taught Masters courses is 1 year. Due to the shorter duration students will be able to save on both tuition fees and living costs and also get a head start on working life as they will graduate earlier.</p>

				<h3>International students support</h3>
				<p>The UK has been welcoming international students from over 100 countries for generations. It has one of the world’s lowest drop-out rates due to a comprehensive support system in place for international students. This includes a dedicated international office, international student societies, planned social activities, academic support and a personal tutor.</p>

			<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Visa application Procedures">
			
			<p>Renowned for its national investment in education, Singapore offers a spectrum of high-quality study programmes to international students studying abroad. What’s more, immigration requirements to study in Singapore are remarkably straightforward, even if you do need a visa to enter the country. Our breakdown of the visa application process will help you get your head around what needs to be done. <br><br>

To study in Singapore you will need something that is called a Student’s Pass. Some students will need a visa to enter the country as well as a Student’s Pass.<br><br>

The application process for a Student’s Pass is the same for students who require and visa and those who don’t: the only difference is that if you need a visa, you’ll have to complete your Student’s Pass application from your home country. Students who do not require a visa to enter Singapore may apply for a Student’s Pass once already in the country.<br><br>

Students from some nationalities will need a visa to enter Singapore. These students may apply for a visa using the Student’s Pass Online Application & Registration (SOLAR+) online system after their host institution has registered them with it. If your visa application is successful, you will be issued a new SOLAR+ application number that you can use to apply for a Student Pass from your home country. You’ll also need to pay an additional visa fee when you collect your Student’s Pass from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Singapore.<br><br>

Check if you need a visa to enter Singapore</p>
			
				<h3>Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning</h3>
				<p>All foreign students accepted into a full-time study programme in a Singapore Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) must apply for a Student Pass online through the SOLAR+ system. Once you complete the forms in the online application system, your host institution will lodge your application to the ICA for you. If your application is successful, you’ll need to complete the formality of going to an ICA office and collecting your Student Pass yourself. <br><br>

Institutions not included on this list will provide you with specific information about your immigration requirements when you are accepted into one of their study programmes.</p>
			
			<h3>Online Application SOLAR+</h3>
			<p>Applications for a Student’s Pass done via SOLAR+ need to be submitted at least one month, but not more than two months before the commencement of your study programme. Before you can submit your application with SOLAR+, your IHL will register you with the system using your personal details as they appear in your passport, course details (including dates of commencement and finish), and your SOLAR+ application reference number. Your host will notify you once this is done, and you must then log onto SOLAR+ to complete the eForm 16.</p>
			<strong>eForm 16</strong>
				
				<p> Before you log onto SOLAR+ to complete the eForm 16, you will need to have the following documents and information handy:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> A registration acknowledgement notice from your host, acknowledging and confirming that they have successfully registered you with the SOLAR+ system</li>
					<li> Passport details: passport number, nationality, date of expiry</li>
					<li> NRIC/ FIN of parents if your parents are either Singaporean or are living or working in Singapore</li>
					<li>Your address in Singapore if applicable. If you haven’t sorted out accommodation yet then you can put your university’s registered address</li>
					<li>Your e-mail address</li>
					<li>One recent passport-sized colour photograph that has been taken within the last 3 months. This will be pasted on the top-right hand corner of the form once it has been printed out.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>Once you have completed the form online through SOLAR+, you need to print a copy of it that you will need to submit in person to the Student’s Pass Unit (ICA) when you go to pick up your pass. You’ll also need to paste a passport-sized photo of yourself onto the top right-hand corner of the form before you do so. <br><br>

The visa application processing time for students that do NOT require a visa to enter Singapore is five days. For students that do require a visa, the processing time is ten days.</p>
		
		<h3>IPA and Additional Requirements</h3>
		<p>If your application is successful, you will be issued an In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter by your host institution. If you require a visa to enter Singapore, it will be attached to this letter. Your IPA letter will act as a provisional Student’s Pass until you go to collect it from an ICA office, and if applicable you can use it to enter the country.</p>
		
		<h3>Collecting your Student’s Pass</h3>
		<p>In some cases, your host university may be authorised by the ICA to issue your Student’s Pass on campus. If not, you will need to contact the ICA and make an appointment to pick up your pass and submit additional documents. You will need to make this appointment within the time frame indicated on your IPA letter. A Student’s Pass will be issued no earlier than a month before the start of your study programme. <br><br>When you arrive to collect your pass, you will need to bring the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>A valid passport and a photocopy of the passport photo page</li>
			<li>The Disembarkation/Embarkation card granted upon entry into Singapore</li>
			<li>One recent colour, passport-sized photograph taken against a white background</li>
			<li>A printout of the eForm 16 submitted through SOLAR that has been signed by you</li>
			<li>A photocopy of your IPA</li>
			<li>A medical report no older than three months</li>
			<li>Relevant fees</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Fees</h3>
		<p>The ICA takes a SGD 30 (US$ 24) non-refundable fee for every application submitted to them. This fee is payable by credit card or internet banking. <br><br>

There is a SGD 60 (US$ 47) issuance fee for A Student’s Pass, and students requiring a visa will need to pay a further SGD 30 visa fee. In both instances, fees are payable to the ICA when students go in person to collect their student pass.</p>
