				<h3>Intensive shorter tertiary education</h3>
				<p>The distinct advantage that the UK education system has is the fact that the duration of most of the undergraduate honours degrees is 3 years and the taught Masters courses is 1 year. Due to the shorter duration students will be able to save on both tuition fees and living costs and also get a head start on working life as they will graduate earlier.</p>

				<h3>International students support</h3>
				<p>The UK has been welcoming international students from over 100 countries for generations. It has one of the world’s lowest drop-out rates due to a comprehensive support system in place for international students. This includes a dedicated international office, international student societies, planned social activities, academic support and a personal tutor.</p>

		<uib-accordion close-others="true">
			<!--<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Support Services for International Students">
				<p>U.S. universities welcome international students for pursuing higher education in USA and have support systems to help students adjust comfortably to life in the U.S. Services at the international student office help students transition to the new environment. Support is offered through the year from organizing orientation programs to assistance with academic writing and building resumes as students get ready to graduate.</p>

			<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Six reasons to study in Malaysia">

				<h3>1. The local universities are getting better</h3>
				<p>
					While not yet a rival to Singapore, Hong Kong, China or Singapore, Malaysia’s domestic universities are fast improving. <br> Universiti Malaya in the capital Kuala Lumpur is ranked 167th in the 2013/14 QS World University Ratings and its computer science, education and engineering programmes preside in the world’s top 100. Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi, Selangor, close to Kuala Lumpur, is well renowned in the education, politics, engineering, law and mathematics fields. And Universiti Sains Malaysia is the only institution in Malaysia to boast a subject in the top 50 – its environmental studies programme is ranked joint 28th.
				</p>
				
				<h3>2. You can get a US, UK and Australian degree there...</h3>
				<p>A major part of Malaysia’s state investment in higher education is its growing partnerships with universities in other countries. Many foreign universities, especially Australian and British, have branch campuses in Malaysia.
For example, Monash University (Australia) and the University of Nottingham (UK), both of which are in the top 100 universities in the world, have branch campuses in Malaysia. <br>
KBU International College is partnered with Anglia Ruskin, Nottingham Trent and Sheffield Hallam universities in the UK.
In the southern Malaysia city of Johor, developers are building EduCity Iskandar, a giant international student village and campus shared by eight leading universities. Four are operational and the others will be completed by the year 2018. They will include the universities of Reading, Southampton and Newcastle (medicine) in the UK, the Netherlands’ Maritime Institute of Technology, Singapore’s private Raffles University and the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts from the US. An Olympic-sized swimming pool and14,000-seat sports stadium are among the impressive facilities the campus will boast when it is completed in 2018.</p>
				
				<h3>3. …at a lower cost</h3>
				<p>While an undergraduate course at the UK Campus of the University of Nottingham would cost £13,470, the same course at the Malaysia campus would cost just under half as much (39,990MYR/ approximately £7,000). The course is the same module content, has the same evaluation criteria and the same marking scheme which results in receiving the same degree with the same status, but at a significantly lower cost. Also take into consideration that the cost of living in Malysia in comparision to that of the UK is considerably lower too which means your maintenance costs are less of a financial burden too. It’s a win-win situation.</p>
				
				<h3>4. It’s majorly multicultural </h3>
				<p>Malaysia is amulti-ethnic melting pot. Just half the population is Malay while almost a quarter is Chinese and over seven per cent is Indian. Whilst Malay is the official language of Malaysia, English is a recognised language and widely spoken. Such a setting is a great foundation for international students to make them feel at home in addition to having a sense of belonging. The global community allows for religious, cultural and social acceptance and is testimony to the fact that Malaysia is home to just under 100,000 international students. Studying at university is not solely an academic experience and having the opportunity to appreciate the different facets, cultures and religions that make up the Malaysian identity is a learning curve in its own right.</p>
				
				<h3>5. It needs skilled graduates. </h3>
				<p>With certain industries on the rise and a growing economy, Malaysia is in need of skilled workers. Industry makes up a significant part of the country’s GDP with oil, gas and palm oil making leaps and bounds in the export markets. In addition, there is a particular demand for graduates in accounting, biotechnology and computer science sectors. Being able to witness the development of these industries will keep you ahead of the game as well as to having the opportunity to network to make the all-important contacts to get your first step on the career ladder.</p>
				
				<h3>It’s simply beautiful</h3>
				<p>Being a student may well be a full time occupation but a break every now and then is surely well deserved! Why not set off and explore the beautiful and diverse landscape Malaysia has to offer? You can wade through the jungle in Taman Negara National Park or head to the rainforest in Malaysian Borneo. Find a reprieve from the humid heat in addition to getting peace and quiet by heading up to the Cameron Highlands. Or walk through a UNESCO Heritage site in the form of the colonial streets of George Town in Penang before savouring the culinary delights there. But if you wish to escape it all, paradise is found in the form of the Perhentian Islands. Wherever you wish to explore, Malaysia has somewhere that will cater to your tastes.</p>

				<h3>Cost of living</h3>
				<p>The factors that contribute to the cost of living include accommodation, food and personal expenses. Accommodation costs will vary depending on where you stay (on or off campus) and the type of accommodation you choose (full board or self-catering). If you choose not to live in university accommodation then you will have to pay Council Tax which is a charge for local community services such as the police, fire brigade, rubbish collection and leisure services. <br><br> Students on full-time courses lasting 6 months or more are eligible for treatment from the National Health Service (NHS). This includes free doctor’s examinations and hospital treatment from the start of your course. Your spouse and children under 16 (or under 19 if still in school) will also be entitled to this benefit. <br><br>Other costs to be included when planning your budget are local travel, telephone, entertainment, clothing, groceries and incidentals. It is also prudent to include international travel costs if you decide to go back home during the semester breaks.

				</p>

			</div>
			<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="Living in Malaysia">


				<p>Accommodation, either on-campus or off-campus, is reasonable and within the students’ budget. The cost of living while you are studying in Malaysia will depend on the location and lifestyle you keep up with.</p><br>

				<p>The average monthly rental for a single room (twin-sharing) per student is between RM250 and RM450 (USD68 to USD122). Other expenses such as food, transportation, laundry and other essentials, based on an ordinary lifestyle, are estimated to be between RM600 and RM700 (USD162 to USD189 per month).</p><br>

				<p>Therefore, the total cost of living will average to approximately between RM900 and RM1,200 (USD243 to USD324) per month or about RM11,000 to RM14,000 (USD 2,973 to USD3,784) per year (12 months) for one student. Again, this is dependent on the student’s style of living, as well as the cost of living that varies from one location to another.</p><br>

	<h3>Immigration Procedures</h3>
				<p>
					The section below will give international students like YOU a more detailed explanation about visas, getting a student pass, and other procedures required in order to enter and stay in Malaysia as a student. Below are the procedures for visa / student pass applications and entering Malaysia to study :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>Procedure 1 :</strong> Applying for a Visa and Student Pass</li>
					<li> <strong>Procedure 2 :</strong> Arriving in Malaysia : At the Malaysia Immigration Check Point</li>
					<li> <strong>Procedure 3 :</strong> Affixing the Student Pass Sticker and Student Pass/Visa Fees </li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div uib-accordion-group class="panel-default" heading="6 Easy Steps">

			<p>Summary : Steps for Obtaining a Visa and Student Pass</p>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
				<p>YOU submit an application/enrolment form with relevant documents to the intended higher educational institution, which has official approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia Immigration Department) to recruit international students.</p>

				<h3>Step 2</h3>
				<p>YOUR application to study is accepted by the educational institution. The institution will then help YOU apply for a student pass at the Malaysian Immigration Department in Malaysia prior to YOUR arrival.</p>

				<h3>Step 3</h3>
				<p>A letter of approval for a student pass will then be released by the Malaysian Immigration Department to the educational institution which has offered YOU a place to study. The educational institution will send the approval letter to YOU while YOU are still in YOUR own country.</p>

				<h3>Step 4</h3>
				<p>Before leaving YOUR country for Malaysia, YOU must inform the educational institution of YOUR port of entry (airport), flight number, arrival date and time.</p>

				<h3>Step 5</h3>
				<p>Upon YOUR arrival at the airport in Malaysia, the educational institution’s representative will receive YOU at the immigration check-point at the Malaysian airport. A visa will be issued to YOU at the entry point in the form of an endorsement on YOUR valid national passport. A Special Pass will be issued at the entry point to refer you to the nearest State Immigration Department for issuance of a Student Pass. (Note: Students from The People’s Republic of China are required to obtain their Entry Visa prior to entering Malaysia)</p>

				<h3>Step 6</h3>
				<p>Within 2 weeks of YOUR arrival, the educational institution will submit YOUR passport to the Immigration Department to affix the Student Pass sticker. This process may take about 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
