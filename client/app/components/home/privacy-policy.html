  <div class="large-centered large-10 end column">
	  <div>
	    <p><strong>Your Privacy Matters</strong></p>
	    <p>At Edu-Action, our fundamental philosophy is “users first.”  This philosophy powers all of the decisions we make, including how we gather and  protect your personal information.</p>
	    <p>We’ve crafted the policy below to be as clear and  straightforward as possible. Our aim is for you—our users—to always feel  informed and empowered with respect to your privacy on Edu-Action.</p>
	    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
	    <p>Edu-Action' mission is to empower students to find and choose  the very best college. Our registered users share their information  with colleges, engage with colleges they're interested in, and post and view  content related to their college-search process. Content on some of our  services is also visible to unregistered viewers. We believe that our services  allow our users to efficiently select the best based on their search criteria.</p>
	    <p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to  the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
	    <p>We protect your personal information and will only provide  it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry  out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our  features and functionality to you; (4) when we reasonably believe it is  required by law, subpoena or other legal process; or (5) as necessary to  enforce our User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service or protect the rights, property, or safety of  Edu-Action, its users and visitors, and the public.</p>
	    <p>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed  to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</p>
	    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Edu-Action.com and other Edu-Action  websites, apps, developer platforms and other products and services(collectively, the “ Services ”). We may  modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes  to it, we will provide notice through our website or by other means so that you  may review the changes before you continue to use Edu-Action. If you object to any  changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use  Edu-Action after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this  Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>What  Information We Collect</strong><br><br></li>
	      <ul>
	        <li><strong>1.1&nbsp; </strong><strong>Data Controllers<br>
	          </strong>The personal information provided to or gathered is controlled by Edu-Action,  231 Market Place #241, San ramon, CA 94583. If you have any concern about  providing information to us or having such information displayed on Edu-Action  services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you  should not become a user of Edu-Action, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use  our Services. If you have already registered, you can close your account. We  collect your personal information in the following ways:<br>
	          <br>
	          <strong></strong></li>
	        <li><strong>1.2&nbsp; </strong><strong>Registration<br>
	          </strong>To create an account on Edu-Action, you must provide us with at least your  name, email address, and a password. You can choose to provide further  information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your mobile number, your  gender and/or your high school). We use this information to provide you with more  customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content,  and this information may also appear on your profile viewable by colleges. You acknowledge  that, by creating an account, Edu-Action and colleges will be able to identify you  by your profile, and you allow Edu-Action to use this information in accordance  with this Privacy Policy.<br>
	          <br>
	          <strong></strong></li>
	        <li><strong>1.3&nbsp; </strong><strong>Profile Information<br>
	          </strong>After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional  information on your Edu-Action profile, such as test scores, certifications,  career goals, and personal interests. With your approval, colleges may choose  to communicate with you based on the information you have provided. Providing  additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Edu-Action. Helping you provide a more complete profile allows prospective colleges to get to know you better. It also enables us to provide you with other relevant content such as scholarship information on and off our site.<br>
	          <br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>1.4   </strong><strong>Other Services That Sync With Edu-Action</strong><br>
            Edu-Action makes other tools available to sync information with Edu-Action, and may also develop additional features that allow users to use their Edu-Action account in conjunction with other third-party services. Any information that you upload or sync with Edu-Action is covered by the User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features Edu-Action makes available.<br><br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>1.5&nbsp; </strong><strong>Customer Support</strong>
	        <br>When you contact our customer support services (support@edu-action.com), we collect information that helps us categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you. <br>

	          We collect information when you use (whether as a user or a visitor) the Services. For example, we collect  information when you import your transcript, participate in polls, install a  Edu-Action mobile application, and share articles on Edu-Action. If you are logged in  on Edu-Action or another Service and a Edu-Action cookie on your device identifies  you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.9 of this  policy(e.g., your IP address) will be associated with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP addresses.</li><br>
	        <li><strong>1.7&nbsp;  </strong><strong>Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</strong><br>
	          We receive information when you use your Edu-Action account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds Edu-Action plugins, we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a user when you visit sites with Edu-Action plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. Edu-Action will use this information to personalize the Edu-Action-provided functionality on third-party sites. Edu-Action may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting Edu-Action plugins and similar technologies to help them measure Edu-Action-generated traffic to their websites.<br>
	          <br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>1.8  </strong><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
	         We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, improve your Edu-Action experience, increase security, measure use and assess effectiveness of our Services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. By visiting Edu-Action, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>

          </ul>
        </ul>
	    <p>When you visit or leave Edu-Action sites or apps (whether as a user or visitor)  by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a plugin on a third-party site, we  automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to  which you are directed. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of  your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer  operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device  (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device  operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Edu-Action  using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may  also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or  GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information  on our mobile applications. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time  location data being sent to Edu-Action, and of course Edu-Action will honor your  settings.<br>

	          Edu-Action is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer our users. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (e.g., limited types of financial information). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</li>

	          The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to  identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile  (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing  personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile,  you are freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal  information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying to us any  information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your  part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to Edu-Action'  collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in  accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, by changing your account  settings or your profile on Edu-Action, or by closing your respective account  here.<br>

	          <br>
            </li>

	          We use information that you provide to us to customize your experience and the experiences of others on Edu-Action.

	          <br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>2.5&nbsp; </strong><strong>Sharing Information with Affiliates<br>
	          </strong>We may share your personal information with our Edu-Action affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Edu-Action) outside of the Edu-Action entity that is your data controller as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing.<br>
	          <br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>2.6&nbsp; </strong><strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
	          We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Edu-Action services without your consent unless Edu-Action has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Edu-Action, our users, visitors, or the public.

          </ul>
        </ul>
	    <p>Content distributed through Edu-Action’ sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of Edu-Action. If you have bound your Edu-Action account to your Twitter account or your Facebook account, you can easily share content from Edu-Action to Twitter or Facebook, in accordance with your applicable account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective Twitter or Facebook policies.  <br>

	         We collaborate with and allow third parties to use Edu-Action' developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with Edu-Action. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use Edu-Action platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to Edu-Action. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. <br>

Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.<br>

	        <li><strong>2.12&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Premium Services</strong><br>
	          We offer customized user-search functionality as part of colleges’ recruiting process. These services allow colleges to export limited information from users' public profiles, in order to effectively recruit prospective students. A college may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a college application, in connection with Edu-Action’ platform. Any personal information obtained independently of Edu-Action services will not be added by Edu-Action to your profile and is not under Edu-Action’ control but is subject to the policies of Edu-Action.<br>
	          <br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>2.13&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Pages for Colleges</strong><br>

            </li>
	        <li><strong>2.14&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Compliance with Legal Process and  Other Disclosures</strong><br>
	          It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a user or visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if Edu-Action has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Edu-Action, our users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not commit to challenge every demand.<br>
	          <br>
            </li>
	        <li><strong>2.15&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Disclosures to Others as the Result  of a Change in Control or Sale of Edu-Action, Inc.</strong><br>
	          We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Edu-Action, Inc., a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events. Any third party to which Edu-Action transfers or sells Edu-Action’ assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>

            </li>
          </ul>

	         You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by Edu-Action regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account.

          </ul>
        </ul>
	    <br>
	    <p>Please note: Information you have shared with colleges or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other colleges may have copied or exported out of Edu-Action, because this information may not be in our control.<br>
        </p>
	    <ul>
	      
	        <li><strong>3.2&nbsp; </strong><strong>Data Retention<br>
	          </strong>We retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services. Edu-Action may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between users, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement &amp; Terms of Service. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Edu-Action’ Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1.<br>

	          California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Edu-Action currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.<br>

          </ul>
        </ul>
	    <p>We have implemented security safeguards designed to protect the personal information that you provide in accordance with industry standards. Access to your data on Edu-Action is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Edu-Action Services. We also offer secure https access to the Edu-Action.com website. All data we collect is stored on our servers located in the United States at a data center in Oregon hosted by Amazon Web Services, Inc. (Amazon). Your personal information will be routed through, and stored on, those servers as part of the service. Amazon has certified that it adheres to relevant US and European Union data privacy regulations. If the location of our servers changes in the future, we will update this Policy. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.  In addition, we have instituted authentication and access controls designed to protect all data in our systems. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to Edu-Action. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, messaging, and similar means of communication with other users and colleges are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password. You should review our policy regularly to keep informed of any updates.</p>
